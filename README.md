<h2><em>Theme For Fish-Shell much like BudSpencer but better in my opinion</em></h2>

<p>
This theme is a fork of barracuda theme for fish-shell.  It was originally authored by Marvin Eversley Silva meverss@gmail.com.

The potential for this theme is almost endless which is why I've started putting time into this project.
<p>
I've added support for containerized distros, prooted distros and even more support for termux.  
I've removed support for antiquited apps like lza and lxa and replaced them with the 'lsd' ls replacement. 
The lsd package should be available for all major distrobutions which is a much better ls replacement.  
There's still work to be done like fixing the __baracuda_detach_session function(s) which is redundant since fish shell has 
those functions built in.
  
<p>
Also I'll be removing support for aliases completely since fish performs beter when using functions.  
Instead...please use 'alias -s shorthand "longhand"'.  This will create a function for the alias you wish to create in 
~/.config/fish/functions.  I'll include the most basic of funtions needed to speed up your workflow.  If you don't like/want
them you can eith remove them or edit them without any ill effects to the theme.  I'll also include "manified" help pages 
in three languages...English, Spanish and German.

There's more enhancements and performance tweaks on the way.  Be patient.  :-)

Oh, and thank you for any and all feedback and for trying this out....
